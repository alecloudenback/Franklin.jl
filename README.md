Franklin is a simple **static site generator** (SSG) oriented towards technical blogging (code, maths, ...) and light, fast-loading pages.
The base syntax is plain markdown with a few extensions such as the ability to define and use LaTeX-like commands in or outside of maths environments and the possibility to evaluate code  blocks on the fly.

Franklin now has a channel/stream **#franklin** on the Julia slack, this is the best place to ask usage question.
For anything that looks suspicious, feel free to open an issue here directly.

## Key features

* Use standard markdown with the possibility to use LaTeX-style commands,
* Simple way to introduce div blocks allowing easy styling on a page (e.g. "Theorem" boxes etc.),
* Can execute and show the output of Julia code blocks,
* Simple optimisation step to accelerate webpage loading speed:
  - compression of HTML and CSS of the generated pages,
  - optional pre-rendering of KaTeX and highlighted code blocks to remove javascript dependency,
* Easy HTML templating to define or adapt a given layout.

See [the docs](https://franklinjl.org) for more information and examples.

## Getting started

With Julia ≥ 1.3:

```julia
pkg> add Franklin
```

you can then get started with

```julia
julia> using Franklin

julia> newsite("MyNewSite")
✔ Website folder generated at "MyNewSite" (now the current directory).
→ Use serve() from Franklin to see the website in your browser.

julia> serve()
→ Initial full pass...
→ Starting the server...
✔ LiveServer listening on http://localhost:8000/ ...
  (use CTRL+C to shut down)
```

Modify the files in `MyNewSite/src` and see the changes being live-rendered in your browser.
Head to [the docs](https://franklinjl.org) for more information.

You can also start from [one of the templates](https://tlienart.github.io/FranklinTemplates.jl/) by doing something like:

```julia
julia> newsite("MyNewSite", template="vela")
```

You might want to put the following command in your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` as a way to quickly launch the server from your terminal:

```
alias franklin=julia -O0 -e 'using Franklin; serve()'
```

### Heads up!

While Franklin broadly supports standard Markdown there are a few things that may trip you which are either due to Franklin or due to Julia's Markdown library, here are key ones you should keep in mind:

* when writing a list, the content of the list item **must** be on a single line (no line break)
* you can write comments with `<!-- comments -->` the comment markers `<!--` and `-->` **must** be separated by a character that is not a `-` to work properly so `<!--A-->` is ok but `<!---A--->` is not, best is to just systematically use a whitespace: `<!-- A -->`.
* be careful writing double braces, `{{...}}` has a *meaning* (html functions) this can cause issues in latex commands, if you have double braces in a latex command, **make sure to add whitespaces** for instance write `\dfrac{1}{ {101}_{2} }` instead of `\dfrac{1}{{101}_{2}}`. In general use whitespaces liberally to help the parser in math and latex commands.
* (as of `v0.7`) code blocks should be delimited with backticks `` ` `` you *can* also use indented blocks to delimit code blocks but you now have to **opt in** explicitly on pages that would use them by using `@def indented_code = true`, if you want to use that everywhere, write that in the `config.md`. Note that indented blocks are **ambiguous** with some of the other things that Franklin provides (div blocks, latex commands) and so if you use them, you are responsible for avoiding ambiguities (effectively that means _not using indentation for anything else than code_)
